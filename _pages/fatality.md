<h2>Fatality Theme</h2>
<p>A responsive theme created for Tumblr to display photos and text elegantly. Currently available through Tumblr's theme garden.</p>

<p>The name Fatality was inspired by the word kill in 'perfect all kill'. A 'perfect all kill' refers to a kpop song that tops all the music charts. I wanted to create a theme that would make it feel like I had accomplished something as amazing as a song that has achieved a perfect all kill.</p>

<p>All photos on the demo blog were taken by me!</p>
