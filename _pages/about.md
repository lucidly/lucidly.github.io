			<p>Hi! My name is Lily, although I prefer going by Lucidly (often shortened to Lucid) on the internet. It's a lot easier to find me this way, trust me!</p>
			<p>I'm an illustrator and designer that can create cute illustrations, write code, design websites, and develop games.</p>
			<p>I have a Bachelor of Science in Interactive Arts + Technology, with concentrations in Design and Interactive Systems.</p>
			<p>My dream is to make the world a better place with the power of cuteness! I believe cuteness can bring joy even in the unlikeliest of places.</p>
			<p>Aside from my work, I like playing games. Especially MMOs and RPGs! You can find me in games acquiring massive amounts of wealth, collecting costumes, and exploring hidden areas.</p>
			<p>If you want to get to know me better, I'd love to become friends!</p>
