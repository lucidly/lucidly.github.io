				<p>Hi! I'm most well known as Lucidly (often shortened to just Lucid) on the internet. It's a lot easier to find me this way, trust me!</p>
				<p>I specialize in illustration but can also do some design work and programming as well. I went to school for a Bachelors of Science in Interactive Arts + Technology, with concentrations in Design and Interactive Systems.</p>
				<p>My work is often simple with a cute and delicate feeling, inspired by the things I love.</p>
				<p>My ultimate goal for the work I do is to make the world a better place with the power of cuteness~</p>
				<p>For other interests, I also like to play games! I am an achiever and explorer who plays MMOs and RPGs. You can find me in games acquiring massive amounts of wealth, collecting costumes, and trying to get past those pesky boundary boxes to find hidden areas.</p>
				<p>If you want to get to know me better, I'd love to become friends!</p>
