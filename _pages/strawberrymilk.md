<h2>Strawberry Milk Kittea</h2>
<img src="/assets/work/strawberrymilk1.png" />

<p>A series of illustrations combining two of my favourite things - strawberry milk tea and kittens. They were created with the intention to be printed on various merchandise through sites like Redbubble. The above image has sold most often as a sticker.</p>
